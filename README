This repo contains an implementation of Vector Space Model of Information Retrieval. 
VSM is the backbone of almost all the search engines. This implementation is built on the MapReduce framework. Here the MapReduce executes entirely on a single machine, it does not involve parallel computation. But it can be easily be extended to the distributed file system.

Scripts : 
1. MapReduce.py - implements mapreduce in python
2. inverted_index - computes inverted index of tf-idf vectors
3. length.py - computes lengths of tf-idf vectors
4. cosine.py - computes cosine similarity with a specific query and returns documents ordered to their relevance. 

Procedure : 
Offline - 
1. python inverted_index "input_corpus_of_documents" > index.txt
2. python length.py index.txt > vector_lengths.txt

Online - 
1. Enter the query in cosine.py
2. python cosine.py vector_length.txt index.txt > output.txt
